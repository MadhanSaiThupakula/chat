# Chat Emotion Analysis  

This project aims to classify user messages into different emotional categories like joy, anger, and sadness using deep learning models.  

## Project Overview  
Emotion analysis plays a crucial role in understanding user sentiment and enhancing user experiences. This project leverages GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) networks to perform emotion classification on chat data.  

## Features  
- Preprocessing of text data (stop word removal, tokenization, and imbalance handling).  
- Deep learning model built with GRU to classify emotions.  
- Achieved over 90% accuracy.  
- Visualization of model performance with accuracy and loss plots.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-emotion-analysis.git
   ```  
2. Install required packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook emotional_training_modified.ipynb
   ```  

## Dataset  
- The dataset used for training contains labeled chat messages representing different emotions.  
- Preprocessing steps include text cleaning, tokenization, and encoding.  

## Results  
- The GRU model achieved over 90% accuracy.  
- Performance improved with slight hyperparameter tuning (epochs = 12).  

## Future Improvements  
- Implement transformer-based models like BERT for improved accuracy.  
- Expand the dataset for better generalization across emotions.  
- Deploy the model as a web service for real-time emotion classification.
